May require minor backend enhancements to expose workflow-level and phase-level metrics if not already available in current API responses.","comment":"Correction on navigation. single-project mode should ALSO display workflow-details, but in fully-collapsed mode by default. And it should progressively load details in the background, so it doesn't slow down the first load."}
